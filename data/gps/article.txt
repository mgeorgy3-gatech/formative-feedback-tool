GPS navigation is a technology that helps people determine their position and find directions using signals from satellites orbiting the Earth. These satellites continuously send timing information that GPS receivers, such as those in smartphones and car navigation systems, use to calculate location. By measuring how long it takes for signals to travel from multiple satellites, the receiver can determine its distance from each one and pinpoint its exact position on the planet.

To work accurately, a GPS device typically needs signals from at least four satellites. Buildings, mountains, and weather can interfere with signal strength, sometimes reducing accuracy. GPS navigation systems also use digital maps to translate position data into meaningful routes, such as turn-by-turn directions. Some systems combine GPS data with additional sensors, like accelerometers and compasses, to maintain navigation when signals are weak.

Although many people confuse GPS with mobile data or internet connectivity, GPS works independently of both. However, internet connections can improve map loading and provide real-time updates like traffic information. Overall, GPS navigation blends satellite timing signals, mathematical calculations, and mapping data to guide users reliably from one place to another.
